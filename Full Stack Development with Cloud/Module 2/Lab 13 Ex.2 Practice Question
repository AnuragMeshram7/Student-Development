Develop a webpage’s user experience using jQuery selectors. Design a basic HTML page with the following elements and objectives:
	Highlight Selection: Create an unordered list (<ul>) with three list items (<li>) containing different animal names (e.g., "Lion," "Elephant," "Giraffe"). When a user clicks on an animal name, apply a highlight by changing the background color of the selected list item.
	Toggle Paragraph: Include a button element and a paragraph (<p>) below it. The paragraph should initially be hidden. When the button is clicked, toggle the visibility of the paragraph using jQuery.
