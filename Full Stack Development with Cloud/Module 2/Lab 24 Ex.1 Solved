Create a database in MySQL and create an employee table and perform CURD operations
Creating Database
Create a Database:You can create a new database using the following SQL command:
CREATE DATABASE new_db;
Use the Database: After creating the database, you need to use it to perform operations within it:
USE new_db;
Create Tables and Start Programming: Now that you have the database set up, you can create tables and start programming with SQL queries. 

1.	 Create an employee table and insert values


CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
emp_name VARCHAR(50),
job_name VARCHAR(50),
manager_id INT,
hire_date DATE,
salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
commission DECIMAL(10, 2),
dep_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, job_name, manager_id, hire_date, salary, commission, dep_id)
VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 'Manager', NULL, '2020-01-15', 5000.00, NULL, 1),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'Developer', 1, '2021-05-10', 4000.00, 500.00, 1),
(3, 'Michael Johnson', 'Analyst', 1, '2019-11-30', 3500.00, NULL, 2),
(4, 'Emily Brown', 'Designer', 2, '2022-02-20', 4200.00, 200.00, 2);

select * from employee;

2. SQL query to find employees who joined before 2020 and return their complete information: Assuming you have a hire_date column in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', you can use the following SQL query to find employees who joined before 2020:
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';


3. Update the salary of a particular employee
UPDATE employee SET salary = 6000.00 WHERE emp_id = 3;
select * from employee;


4. Delete the details of particular employee
DELETE FROM employee WHERE emp_id = 4;
select * from employee;
