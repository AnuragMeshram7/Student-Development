You are given temperature data for a week in Celsius. Create a Pandas Series to represent this data and perform various operations on it.
---------------------------------------

import pandas as pd

# Given temperature data for a week (in Celsius)
temperature_data = [25, 27, 26, 23, 24, 22, 28]

# Create a Pandas Series from the temperature data
temperature_series = pd.Series(temperature_data)

# Print the entire Series
print("Temperature Series:")
print(temperature_series)

# Find the maximum temperature
max_temp = temperature_series.max()
print("Maximum Temperature:", max_temp)

# Calculate the average temperature
avg_temp = temperature_series.mean()
print("Average Temperature:", avg_temp)

# Check if there are temperatures above 25°C
above_25 = temperature_series > 25
print("Temperatures above 25°C:")
print(temperature_series[above_25])

# Calculate the temperature range (difference between max and min)
temp_range = max_temp - temperature_series.min()
print("Temperature Range:", temp_range)
