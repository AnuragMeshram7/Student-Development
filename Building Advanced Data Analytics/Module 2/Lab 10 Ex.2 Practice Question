 A company claims that their new website design leads to a higher average time spent by users on the website. The previous average time spent was 120 seconds. To test this claim, a sample of 40 users was taken, and their average time spent on the new website was found to be 128 seconds with a standard deviation of 15 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test at a 5% significance level to determine if there is enough evidence to support the company's claim.
