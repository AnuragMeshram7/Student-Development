You have the exam scores of a class. Write a Python program to load the scores into a Pandas Series and calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and the percentage of scores above 70.

-------------------------------------------

import pandas as pd

# Given exam scores of a class
scores = [85, 92, 78, 60, 95, 88, 72, 65, 90, 82]

# Create a Pandas Series from the exam scores
scores_series = pd.Series(scores)

# Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation
mean_score = scores_series.mean()
median_score = scores_series.median()
std_deviation = scores_series.std()

# Calculate the percentage of scores above 70
above_70_count = scores_series[scores_series > 70].count()
total_scores = scores_series.count()
percentage_above_70 = (above_70_count / total_scores) * 100

# Display the results
print("Exam Scores:")
print(scores_series)
print("Mean Score:", mean_score)
print("Median Score:", median_score)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_deviation)
print("Percentage of Scores Above 70:", percentage_above_70, "%")
